# Professional Self-Assessment

As I reflect on my journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I am filled with a sense of accomplishment. The completion of my capstone project, which included three different artifacts from other courses, is a testament to my dedication and commitment. These enhancements have not only showcased my technical knowledge and capabilities but also helped me align my career goals and values in the dynamic field of computer science. Throughout my coursework, I have developed many skills essential for the tech industry, such as problem-solving, teamwork, and effective stakeholder collaboration. These skills are crucial for thriving in a team environment, with the ability to engage with the user to understand their needs and communicate possible new ideas and risks. 

One of the most significant projects within my ePortfolio is the Calendar Tracker app, which was designed in Android Studio using Kotlin. This project allowed me to dive deep into software design, where I could implement new features such as a notification system, customizable themes, and a more user-friendly application. My commitment to best coding practices, which induced more comments throughout the code, and a user-centered design approach were the key factors that made this app successful. This project not only displays my ability to develop functional software applications but also my unwavering focus on user experience, a critical aspect that sets me apart in the job market. Additionally, the process of creating this app has backed my understanding of the software engine principles and best practices, making me more ready to start on real projects within a professional setting. 

My second key artifact is a text-based game that shows my knowledge and proficiency in algorithms and data structures. Key features I added were an NPC interaction, random encounters, and a side quest system; this shows my understanding of complex algorithms, which all achieved more user engagement. The backtracking system I implemented shows my ability to apply theoretical concepts to different scenarios, making it more interactive and bringing any user a high level of engagement. This project fulfilled more course objectives and showed my creativity in game design! Within this project, I gained more hands-on experience and knowledge on how to apply effective algorithms, which is vital for creating impactful software solutions. 

The last key artifact I worked on was the AnimalTracker database, built within code; this successful database shows my comprehensive approach to software development. I created a robust database to manage an animal adoption system, which showed off my database design and user interaction skills. This project has many features, such as multiple tables, automated triggers, and advanced SQL queries, which ultimately show my ability to manage intricate data relations effectively. Overcoming challenges, such as building this project in a new environment due to virtual lab constraints, demonstrates my ability to adapt and my problem-solving skills, which are critical for any technical role. My experience within this has solidified my understanding of creating solid and robust databases and implementing security best practices, which will help me prepare for complex real-world data handling. 

Throughout my journey, I have created all my projects without group projects. However, I was not alone. I actively engaged with peers for peer review feedback and had discussions about specific software IDEs, etc. This experience has taught me the importance of collaboration and the value of seeking and incorporating feedback. Even with small projects, I have realized that you should always let another person look over your work. Teamwork is critical in software development, primarily when tasked with larger projects. Looking back at all these enhancements, I am proud to see where I have come from and how much I have grown. This journey has reinforced the importance of collaboration and stakeholder communication in my work. 

As I look forward to advancing in my career, I am eager to apply these skills in a professional setting. My portfolio showcases my growth and readiness to contribute to the tech industry. Each artifact in this portfolio reflects my journey from a novice coder to a competent developer. I have built a strong foundation in software engineering and consistently adhere to coding best practices. This foundation demonstrates my ability to contribute effectively to all types of projects and teams. I am excited to apply my knowledge to real-world scenarios, confident in my ability to make impactful contributions to future employers and the evolving field of computer science. 

In summary, this professional self-assessment not only showcases my technical abilities and growth but also my commitment to striving for the best and my eagerness for continuous learning. As I transition into a technical workforce, I am eager to apply my skills and make impactful contributions. I am confident that I  can contribute to the evolving field of computer science.  As I embark on the next chapter of my life, I look forward to applying the skills I have learned in a dynamic environment, fostering team collaboration, and maintaining a passion for continuous learning.
